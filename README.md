### ***App Overview***
#### This is an app to display favorite coffee shops and their ratings. Users will be allowed to post reviews and ratings for each shop. 
***
***
### ***Getting Started***
#### Users will arrive at Home Page and see the Listings section which will be clickable. That will display a page with links to different coffee shops. Each coffee shop will have it's own "card" with details. Users will be able to post reviews for each coffee shop as well as delete them. In the real world users would only be able to report others reviews and delete ones they authored.

My longtime friend [Blake Ball](https://www.linkedin.com/in/blake-ball-35845845/), who is a Senior Front End Engineer, walked through my code with me and helped me understand why some things were not working the way that I wanted them to. He also helped me understand that I could add an image to the card objects and then call that when I pushed the cards to the array.
